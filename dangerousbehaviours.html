            <h2>Dangerous Behaviours when Driving</h2>
            <h3>Mobile Phone Use</h3>
            <p style = "text-align: left; padding: 20px;  padding-top: 0px;">There seems to be public confusion regarding the dos and don'ts of laws surrounding mobile phones and the road. A study in 
                                                                            Queensland found 42% of drivers had broken these laws demonstrating an unawareness surrounding these laws. On an unrestricted license you can use a mobile phone
                                                                            to answer calls through audio functions or bluetooth given your phone is in the cradle. Phones can also be used for navigation given the phone
                                                                            is in a fixed cradle. Digital payment services can be used if you are are stationary and located off the road. Outside from these circumstances
                                                                            it is illegal to use your phone if you are a provisional or learner driver, or your vehicle is not stationary and away from the road.</p>
            <img src = "images/dangbehaviour2.jpg" style = "width: 680px;">
            <p style = "font-size: small; width: 680px; margin: auto;">The image above demonstrates an example of what is considered to be a phone cradle under the law (NRMA, 2021).</p>
                                                                            <h3>Drugs and Alcohol</h3>
            <p style = "text-align: left; padding: 20px;  padding-top: 0px;">Upon taking drugs (illegal or legal) or Alcohol the risks of an injury and a crash are increased. Hence,
                                                                            consumption of drugs or alcohol (alcohol in amounts above 0.05 blood alcohol concentration) is unwise. In fact
                                                                            when blood alcohol levels exceed 0.05 the casualty risk when driving doubles and the risk of involvement in a crash 
                                                                            sharply increases. Since 2017, in 37% of all fatalities involving drivers or motorcyclists the victims had drugs in their system.
                                                                            So you are all round increasing the likelihood of fatalities not to mention a potential sentence of 14 years if you have a crash 
                                                                            whilst under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Not to mention for learners and provisional license drivers there is a zero tolerance
                                                                            policy for drugs and alcohol.</p>
            <h3>Fatigue</h3>
            <p style = "text-align: left; padding: 20px;  padding-top: 0px;">Driving whilst tired can have similar affects to driving whilst under the influence. If you have not slept in 17 hours
                                                                            the affect is similar to a blood alcohol level of 0.05. Sleeping for 4-5 hours in the past 24 hours increases the chance of a 
                                                                            crash increases by 4.5 times or more when compared to a driver with seven hours sleep. With just four hours of sleep there is a 11.5 times
                                                                            increase in the likelihood of a crash. </p>
